= UNSW Security Engineering COMP6441 and COMP6841 Final Theory Exam: 2020t1 =
=== 6441 -> 180 marks + 5 bonus marks / 4 hours ===
=== 6841 -> 120 marks + 5 bonus marks / 4 hours ===
v1.5

There is a 5 mark bonus if you correctly follow all exam instructions.  

There are 14 questions, all worth equal marks, but don't answer them all:
COMP6441 students only answer 12 questions.
COMP6841 students only answer 8 questions.  

=== Extra note for 6841 students ===
6841 students also complete a 60 mark technical exam (sent to you one hour into the exam 
in a separate document) which runs concurrently with this exam.  You will need to allocate 
your time between the two exams yourself.  Both start and finish at the same time.

If you are not answering a question write NOT ANSWERED in the answer area(s). We think the earlier questions are easier than the later ones so we suggest you choose to answer those questions but it is entirely up to you.  Do not answer more than the required number of questions.  If you answer more than the required number of questions then we will ONLY mark the FIRST questions you answered.  

DO NOT edit/add/delete ANY text ANWHERE outside of the answer areas indicated.  That will muck up poor Lachlan having to split up and extract your answers for marking using scripts.  You will lose the bonus marks for following instructions if you do this.

Make frequent backup copies of your completed exam paper as you go so if anything goes wrong you do not lose much work.  There are no time extensions for accidentally deleting work - that is a foreseeable and mitigable risk for security professionals.

Type/write your answers into the indicated areas and submit via give using the instructions on the exam central page. You must use a text editor (eg NOT Microsoft Word) and submit a text only file.  We cannot mark an answer file with formatting like italics or containing non-ascii characters etc.  You may submit your answer file as many times as you like over the duration of the exam. The last submission ONLY will be marked.  If you have problems submitting you can email your exam answer paper (in text only format) to cs6441@cse.unsw.edu.au.

This is a logged open book exam.  You may READ anything you like on the internet or in books etc but you must disclose what you have read.  Below paste the titles of any books you consult and the urls of any documents/webpages you consult:

You may not WRITE or SHARE anything on the internet or with any other person during this exam with the exception for asking questions described below.  You cannot communicate with any other person or share any information including the exam paper. This includes making comments on the course web pages or make any comments anywhere including sms, texts, on social media / chats etc.  You cannot make or answer phone calls.  Violating these read-only restrictions is regarded as cheating and will result in 0 fail and possible charges of academic misconduct and even more serious penalties.  But mainly it’s not the honourable thing to do.


Permitted Communication 
(start at the top of the list and only move down if needed)
      
You are permitted to contact the exam supervisor in the following ways:
1. 
You can ask about the process of the exam and ask for clarification about rules or typos in the question wording (but do not give any hints about answer content) by making comments on the Exam-Live page.  THIS IS THE ONLY PAGE YOU CAN MAKE COMMENTS ON DURING THE EXAM PERIOD. The URL for the Exam-Live page is 

      https://www.openlearning.com/unswcourses/courses/sec-2020/exam-live/

2. You can also email cs6441@cse.unsw.edu.au with question but that may not be noticed as quickly as comments.  
3. In case of last resort you can call or message us on the exam mobile phone number which we will tell you on the morning of the exam.  

Updates on the exam will be posted on the Exam-Live page.  Keep the page open all exam and refresh it regularly for updates.  

If you are unsure about anything ask the supervisor.

Please do not discuss the exam or content at all with anyone until Sunday 8pm or reveal anything about the questions. There are a number of people around the world doing the exam at later times – they will all be finished by Sunday 8pm Sydney time.  You can write a indication of joy/relief/support on the Exam-Live page at the end of the exam if you are happy that you finished, but please no more until Sunday 8pm.  Examples below:

Good examples (permitted)
Yay!  
So glad I am now free and can relax unlike Richard and the other markers who now have to work without pause for a week.  Mwahahaha!
Now I will sleep for days

Bad examples (not permitted before sunday 5pm,as they reveal something about the exam itself)
That was easy
That was hard
I am so glad there was no question about sony playstations
It's unfair there was a question about Apollo 13!  I didn't realise the case studies were examinable.

The use of Top Men, misdirection, or unauthorised social engineering is prohibited.

If you think a question is ambiguous, answer the most likely interpretation and state what you have done. Where two or more different answers are possible give the answer which best answers the question. If you need to make assumptions state them. Keep answers brief and clear.  Stick to the word limits.  When you order things put the most important things first.  Make sure you explain your thinking to demonstrate your analysis where ever asked.

Have fun.  Be yourself.  You are a great thinker I can't wait to see what you come up with.

参考:
•	Security through obscurity - Press being shut down and not being allowed entry/access into critical areas. Trying to shut down the footage of the accident after they found out about the footage of the accident existed
•	Motive to cover up security risks - Investors behind power plant didn’t want it being offline and making no revenue. New plant seeking approval to open up very soon, knew a security risk with current plant would certainly trigger checks into the new plant
•	Insider threat - In this case, the insider (jack) was actually the good guy, but we still see the same traits of an insider threat. Someone on the inside being converted to another way of thinking/being coerced into helping someone outside, and using their access inside to help the outsiders get in.
•	Security measures inside facility - One security measure that was in place was the deadlock doors outside of the control room. They could not be opened from the outside, only the inside. In the case of this movie, it allowed the good guys to win, but in the case of an attacker, would allow them to have access to the control room while also locking everyone else out. Makes the system vulnerable to insiders and compromised people. 
•	Lack of redundancy - The accident happened as a result of human error in reading the instruments, which then prompted the wrong response from the staff inside the control room. There was a lack of redundancies that allowed this to happen, which should have kicked in when the system detected the water level going too low.  
•	Personal Assets - each character is driven by what they find important. Reporter woman Kimberly is driven by journalistic integrity and revealing the truth. Supervisor Godell is driven by keeping the plant itself safe, and making sure it’s secure. Chairman That Looks Like Stephen Fry is driven by making the most money possible. Plant Overseer is driven by keeping his boss happy. The person who did the x rays of the components of the reactor was motivated by money and took shortcuts onaly making (i think it was 2 from memory) xrays (self interest, not sure if this is seperate) 
•	Lack of Just Culture - one of the employees of the plant (Ted) gets all defensive when Jack questions him on what he thought was going on during the emergency. Ted (understandably) thinks that the investigation is just looking for a scapegoat, someone to blame & fire for the accident, so is wary of saying anything that can be used against him. This is the opposite of a Just Culture of shared/open accountability, and is what happens when investigations are more focused on finding people to punish rather than on preventing the problem from happening again.

隐藏式保全-媒体被关闭，不允许进入/进入关键区域。在他们发现事故录像存在后试图关闭事故录像
•掩盖安全风险的动机——发电厂背后的投资者不希望它下线后没有收入。新工厂寻求批准，很快开放，知道当前工厂的安全风险肯定会触发对新工厂的检查
•内部威胁——在这种情况下，内部(jack)实际上是好人，但我们仍然看到内部威胁的相同特征。内部的人被转变成另一种思维方式/被强迫帮助外部的人，并利用他们在内部的权限帮助外部的人进入。
•设施内部的安全措施-其中一项安全措施是控制室外面的死锁门。它们无法从外面打开，只能从里面打开。在这部电影中，它允许好人获胜，但在攻击者的情况下，它允许他们进入控制室，同时将其他人锁在外面。让系统容易受到内部人士和受伤害人士的攻击。
•缺乏冗余——事故的发生是由于人为错误读取仪器，导致控制室内的工作人员做出了错误的反应。由于缺乏冗余，导致了这种情况的发生，当系统检测到水位过低时，就应该启动。
•个人资产——每个角色都被他们认为重要的东西所驱动。女记者金伯利以新闻的正直和揭露真相为动力。主管戈德尔的动力是确保核电站本身的安全，确保它是安全的。看起来像斯蒂芬·弗莱(Stephen Fry)的董事长是为了尽可能多赚钱。让老板高兴是工厂监工的动力。那个给反应堆组件做x光的人是受钱的驱使，走捷径，只做了x光(我记得是2张)(自我利益，不确定这是不是独立的)
•缺乏公正的文化——当杰克问工厂的一名员工(泰德)他认为在紧急情况下发生了什么时，他变得非常自卫。泰德(可以理解)认为调查只是在寻找替罪羊，有人要为事故负责，所以他小心翼翼地避免说任何可能对他不利的话。这与共享/公开问责的公正文化是相反的，当调查更专注于寻找惩罚对象，而不是防止问题再次发生时，就会发生这种情况。

=== Question 3 ===
You are applying for the role of Director of Security Operations at a major international airline.  Your first task will be to oversee the design, build, and operation of a new Operation Center to detect and co-ordinate response to security incidents and emergencies.  (For simplicity assume that this is an entirely new setup and you will not have to worry about security in the period until the center goes live in 12 months time - in the interim the Interim director will be operating the old center.)

The interviewers ask you to outline what insights the Apollo 13 Mission provides you in the three sub-questions below


Q3.1 Should there be a seperate Cyber Operations Center or should there be one combined center for all incident and emergency response? [1 word SEPERATE or COMBINED]

=== Question 4 ===

Yahoo logs and tracks users of its services and websites and those of its affiliates.  By one measure it is estimated to generate over 2,500 records per month for each of its visitors.  

In October 2016, Reuters reported that Yahoo! had created software to search their customers e-mail at the request of the NSA or FBI.  Also, according to the Washington Post in 2013 the NSA tapped Yahoo's internal optical fibre network and in the previous 30 days had "intercepted" and recorded 181 million new records from Google and Yahoo! internal networks.

You use Yahoo for email. If you didn't trust Yahoo to secure the data it collects on you, to what extent would encrypting your emails before you sent them solve this problem?

[A] It would completely solve the problem
[B] It would largely, but not entirely, solve the problem
[C] It would have a small impact, but the problem would remain largely unsolved
[D] It would not be of any help whatsoever

To what extent?  [one letter, A or B or C or D - see above for meaning]
 NOT ANSWERED

Justify your answer: [60-300 words]
 NOT ANSWERED 



=== Question 5 ===
This question involves devising (but not executing) a way to effectively and realistically perform social engineering on UNSW's CISO.  You must not do anything illegal rude disrespectful or invasive in the real world in preparing for this question, or inconvenience or annoy or alarm the CISO or anyone who works for or with or knows them.  Most importantly you are not to invade the privacy of their family or personal life in any way.  You are restricted to looking at publicly available information and otherwise using entirely passive methods.
CISO: 首席信息安全官(Chief Information Security Officer)
What is the name of the UNSW CISO? [0-2 words]
Derek Winter
Name one significant (but not personal or intrusive) thing about the UNSW CISO you learned in your recon? [0-75 words]
 NOT ANSWERED 
Clearly explain a simple and safe social engineering strategy an an attacker could follow to have the CISO visit a webpage they control.  (To be clear - don't actually do this in the real world - you could face charges and/or be expelled from uni).  Assume the attacker has roughly the same access and resources that you yourself have available to you. [80-400 words]
 NOT ANSWERED 
 
 社会工程攻击资料:
https://digitalguardian.com/blog/social-engineering-attacks-common-techniques-how-prevent-attack

All marks for the strategy response, none for the recon responses. You'll be assessed on how realistic, specific, simple, effective, non-risky, time consuming (sooner is better than later!) your strategy is, and how likely the attacker is to be successful.


=== Question 6 ===
This question consists of three quick mini-questions.  5 marks each.

6.1 How would you reply to the following (good) posted question?
"Hi Richard, a friend accidentally clicked show contents (images) in a spam email, would my friends device or account be at risk?"

Your response post: [60-300 words]
 NOT ANSWERED 



6.2 After noticing how easily SECedu student Brian was able to brute force decrypt the sample encrypted exam we sent out on Wednesday (see image BriansBrain.png) I thought of a different way (described below as method B) that we could arrange the protection of the exam paper which might provide extra security. Although it is too late to implement method B in time for the exam this year, we could use it next year - should we?  

The proposed new method B: 
 * Zip all the exam files into an archive, and use the zip program's own aes feature to encrypt the archived files using a passphrase.  
 * Then use openssl to further encrypt the encrypted zip file using a second passphrase and something like 
       openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in examfiles.zip -out examfiles.zip.enc -md sha256 
 * mail everyone the file examfiles.zip.enc
 * at the start of the exam: email both passphrases to everyone.  
 
Having two layers of encryption should provide more security than just having one.

Should we use Method B next year?  (yes/no)  [1 word]
 NOT ANSWERED 
 
NO

Why? [60-300 words]
 NOT ANSWERED 

Is double encryption RSA more secure?
For RSA. Using plain, paddingless RSA, double encrypting with the same key wouldn't increase security at all, since composing RSA encryption results in a single RSA encryption with a combined key.

6.3  Puzzle
One of the rabbits in the accompanying file Rabbit.png doesn't have a twin.  Can you spot it?  OK you can't get a uni degree for that.  But suppose the problem was made a bit harder and scaled up in some way(s). eg more rabbits, more features, triplets not twins, ...  

Describe how you solved the problem (or how you would solve the scaled up problem if that would be different) [60-300 words]

=== Question 7 ===

The police have asked your advice.  A company is offering them an app for their smart phones which, if they point the phone's camera at someone, identifies them instantly and displays their corresponding drivers licence number. Each state already kindly provides the police with all the Australian Drivers License photos and numbers in real time. 

Obviously that amount of data is too big to download onto police phones so the service that this company offers is that the company analyses the set of Australian photos each night by running a super secret AI training algorithm.  The algorithm generates a database which stores for each person a facial hash of some sort and their driver's licence number.  The database is quite small, X bytes say, and the lastest version can be dowloaded onto phones each day.

The police ask you if this sounds plausible to you?  Is it possible the database could just be X bytes in size?

Answer the question assuming X is 10,000,000.
Is it possible for the App to work as promised if the database was just 10 Megabytes in size?  [One word - YES or NO]

警方征求了你的意见。一家公司正在为他们的智能手机提供一款应用程序，如果他们将手机的摄像头对准某人，就能立即识别他们，并显示相应的驾驶执照号码。每个州已经友好地向警方实时提供所有澳大利亚驾照的照片和号码。
显然，这一数据量太大，无法下载到警方的手机上，因此该公司提供的服务是，通过运行一个超级秘密的人工智能训练算法，每晚分析澳大利亚的一组照片。该算法生成一个数据库，为每个人存储某种类型的面部散列和他们的驾照号码。这个数据库非常小，据说有X个字节，最新版本每天都可以下载到手机上。
警察问你这听起来是否合理?是否有可能数据库的大小是X字节?

=== Question 8 ===
A friend tells you about a problem her dad has, and asks you for your advice.

He is a retired medical expert who has been making public comments critical of some other country's response to the Corona pandemic, and he has been getting a small online following.  A few days ago he woke to found abusive posts made under his name on his social media accounts - but he had not made them.  At the same time his website was defaced with some nationalistic content and remarks threatening him for telling lies about that country.  

He is very worried that he has been hacked. 

What should he do?  Buy new computers?  Start over from scratch? 

List your recommendations about what he should do? [100 - 500 words]

=== Question 11 ===

This question refers to the film "The China Syndrome" we watched in week 8, and the place and the time and the situations depicted in that film.  Suppose you were the security advisor to the President of the United States at the time.

{{{
	Kimberly: We could have been killed.
   Executive: Isn't that stretching it a bit?
    Kimberly: You think so?
   Executive: They say you were never in danger

   PR guy: I have an announcement. 
           A few minutes ago, the situation was resolved.
           The Ventana nuclear plant is secure.
           I stress that the public was never in any danger.
 Reporter: Was there any damage?
   PR guy: Yes, but it was totally contained. A disturbed 
           employee was humoured, so that we could regain control.
 Reporter: Had he been drinking?
   PR guy:  Yes, we think so.
}}}

Although there were two potentially catastrophic incidents neither led to a catastrophe occurring.  If it hadn't been for the particular character and actions of the operator Jack, and the co-incidental presence of Kimberly and her camera crew it is likely that the public would never even have known of the risk they had been in.  

The President is horrified and askes you "Is it likely there are other catastrophic risks known to some people but of which I am not aware?  How can this be? What can be done to improve this situation, so I know the important things I need to know."

Draft your reply (use bullet points and keep it brief - the US President is very busy!)

Is it likely? [1-10 words]
YES
 
How can this be? [25-125 words]
任何事件都有可能发生，即便这是小概率事件。
